    Re:SET Bay Area at Stanford’s Frost Amphitheater was my first mini-festival—and it was only about two miles from home! The open-air bowl was packed with thousands of people spread out across the grass, all there for four sets: Bartees Strange, Dijon, Clairo, and boygenius. I’m a longtime boygenius (and Phoebe <em>Bridgers</em>) fan, so I was basically vibrating with excitement before they even went on.
 
  <p> It was also the first concert where I picked the bands myself, which made it feel extra personal. The atmosphere at Frost—trees, summer light, and a stage that seems to float—made it easy to just be in the music.  </p>

    Clairo’s set won me over right away. She has this quiet, shy vibe on stage, but the songs land big in a crowd. When she played “4EVER” and “Amoeba,” the whole place lit up—people stood, danced, and sang along like it was a shared secret we all knew. It felt intimate even with thousands of people around.

    Boygenius closed the night and turned it into a full-body goosebumps moment. They opened with an a cappella harmony offstage and then ran through favorites—“Emily I’m Sorry,” “True Blue,” “Cool About It,” “Me &amp; My Dog,” and “Not Strong Enough”—each one building the energy higher. I love how Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker, and Lucy Dacus blend; their voices lock together in a way that feels both delicate and huge at the same time.

    Bartees Strange and Dijon added a lot to the day’s arc—Bartees with sharp, guitar-driven dynamics and Dijon with a loose, soulful set that made the amphitheater feel like a big backyard. As a whole, the lineup flowed surprisingly well for a single-day festival.
