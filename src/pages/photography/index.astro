  <p class="intro">
    Photography has always been part of my life and my family’s story. My mom has worked as a professional photographer, and some of my earliest memories are sitting with her to evaluate and edit images.

    I’ve usually had a camera close at hand—sometimes an iPhone, sometimes one of those indestructible Olympus ToughShots that could survive almost anything. For me, taking photos has always been less about equipment and more about the way images can freeze a moment and make it last.

    About four years ago, I began to take my own photography more seriously. At first, I focused on flowers and simple scenes around me, but over time I’ve expanded my interests. These days, I especially enjoy abstract compositions, architectural details, and atmospheric shots that capture the feeling of the places I visit.

    This section brings together different facets of that journey—from travel photography to more experimental work. It’s both a record of what I’ve seen and a way of seeing the world more closely.
