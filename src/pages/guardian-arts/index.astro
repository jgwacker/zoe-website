  <p class="intro">
    Guardian Arts is a discipline that weaves together parkour, mixed martial arts, yoga, 
    and mindfulness into a single practice rooted in the protection of community.

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I started Guardian Arts when I was four years old as a Ling. Over the years I advanced through 
      Halflings and Younglings, and in November 2022 I completed the Dawn Trial, joining the Sun Clan. 
      Since May 2024 I have served as a Shadow Instructor, teaching the Lings on Sundays. I am 
      currently training toward Shadow 2 Instructor certification, which will allow me to run courses 
      independently.

    <h2>About Guardian Arts</h2>
    <p>
      Guardian Arts is more than just a martial arts program — it blends parkour,
      mixed martial arts, yoga, and mindfulness into a single practice that emphasizes
      resilience, adaptability, and service. Instead of training only for sport or
      competition, the focus is on building the strength and calm needed to
      <em>protect and support the community</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system replaces traditional belts with a clan-based structure. Advancement
      is not only about skill but also about how well students care for others,
      contribute to their peers’ growth, and demonstrate readiness in real-world
      environments. Training includes playful but challenging “shatter matches,”
      cooperative games, and sparring that emphasize learning and safety while still
      pushing students outside their comfort zones.
    </p>

    <p>
      As students progress, they face increasingly realistic scenarios — moving from
      padded gyms into unpredictable environments, and combining disciplines in ways
      that teach both physical mastery and mental focus. The practice encourages
      students to connect with movement in its most natural form, to face fear and
      discomfort directly, and to embody care as the guiding principle of self-discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
      Guardian Arts also has a strong social mission: preserving Indigenous traditions,
      creating inclusive spaces for youth and adults alike, and offering programs for
      people with special needs. At its core, it is about cultivating people who are
      both strong and compassionate — ready to serve their community with courage,
      creativity, and care.
