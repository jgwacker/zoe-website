    <h2>My Journey</h2>

    <h3>Watchers</h3>
    <p> The start of Guardian Arts for all ages is with a group of classes for "Watchers" where we are learning basic skills. These are organized by skill and age. I started at 4 years old in late 2017 with the youngest group "Lings".</p>
    <p>
      Over the years I advanced through Halflings and Younglings, working my way up in skill as well. I loved the parkour aspects the training initially. I would spend hours after class practicing courses.  But over time as they strated to bring in the fighting, I began to really enjoy that. I became really good at a choke hold and they started to call me the "Zoe-Constrictor" because I could quickly get my opponents into a headlock causing them to submit.</p>
     <h3>Journey Track</h3>
      <p>
      In November 2022 I completed the Dawn Trial, joining the Sun Clan. In the Sun Clan, learning happens through independent study -- each clan member learns at their own pace, teaching us self-direction.  During my time in Sun Clan, I continued to develop my fighting skills and my aerial work. 
      </p>
      <h3> Shadow Training</h3>
      <p>
      Since May 2024 I have served as a Shadow Instructor, teaching the Lings on Sundays. I am 
      currently training toward Shadow 2 Instructor certification, which will allow me to run courses independently. I love working with the 3 to 5 year olds, helping them through the courses, just like the shadows at the time did for me. It realy brings me around full circle.

    <h2>About Guardian Arts</h2>
    <p>
      Guardian Arts is more than just a martial arts program — it blends parkour,
      mixed martial arts, yoga, and mindfulness into a single practice that emphasizes
      resilience, adaptability, and service. Instead of training only for sport or
      competition, the focus is on building the strength and calm needed to
      <em>protect and support the community</em>.

      The system replaces traditional belts with a clan-based structure. Advancement
      is not only about skill but also about how well clan members care for others,
      contribute to their peers’ growth, and demonstrate readiness in real-world
      environments. Training includes playful but challenging “shatter matches,”
      cooperative games, and sparring that emphasize learning and safety while still
      pushing students outside their comfort zones.
    </p>

    <p>
      As students progress, they face increasingly realistic scenarios — moving from
      padded gyms into unpredictable environments, and combining disciplines in ways
      that teach both physical mastery and mental focus. The practice encourages
      students to connect with movement in its most natural form, to face fear and
      discomfort directly, and to embody care as the guiding principle of self-discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
      Guardian Arts also has a strong social mission: preserving Indigenous traditions,
      creating inclusive spaces for youth and adults alike, and offering programs for
      people with special needs. At its core, it is about cultivating people who are
      both strong and compassionate — ready to serve their community with courage,
      creativity, and care.
