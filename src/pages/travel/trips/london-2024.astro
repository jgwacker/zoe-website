I went to London in February 2024 for Mid-Winter break while a lot of my friends headed to Tahoe. We stayed near the Tower of London, which felt very “old-meets-new” every time we walked by the river. On Sunday afternoon we found a pub and had a proper Sunday roast—crispy potatoes, gravy, the whole deal—then rode the London Eye that evening to see the Thames sparkle below. The next morning we had brunch with a view back toward the Eye and the city skyline. Another day I tried a full English breakfast (black pudding, fried eggs, beans, tomatoes, streaky bacon). It was way too much food, but also kind of awesome.

The week was packed with sights and <em>sites</em>. At the British Museum I loved the Mesopotamian and Egyptian galleries, and seeing the Rosetta Stone in person was a total “pinch me” moment. It was also a little strange to think about these one-of-a-kind objects being so far from where they were found—especially pieces from Assyria and Ur. I was fascinated by the Sutton Hoo helmet too; it looks like it could wake up and start talking.

At the Natural History Museum I got to see the famous “Lucy” (a cast of the Australopithecus afarensis fossil). Thinking about how long she was buried before being discovered made my brain feel tiny—in a good way. Between that and all the dinosaur skeletons, it felt like time travel with really cool lighting.

One huge highlight was dinner at The Harwood Arms. It’s a cozy spot outside the center, and we did a prix fixe menu for the first time. The freshly churned butter with sea salt and the warm Guinness soda bread were ridiculous. There was an onion tart so rich and umami that I almost couldn’t finish it, and then a beautiful beef-in-pastry main—classic British flavors, just super elevated. Another food adventure was Brick Lanefor Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi meals; we went more than once and tried new dishes each time. I kept thinking about how Chicken Tikka Masala is practically a national dish here.

I also had afternoon tea at Fortnum &amp; Mason—it’s such a posh department store. I loved being there. It was my first time having proper afternoon tea with sandwiches, and I enjoyed the whole experience. I’ve even started drinking tea whenever I get the chance.

We also did some amazing day trips and shows. In Salisbury I saw one of the surviving copies of the Magna Carta at the cathedral, and then we headed to Stonehenge. Some people say it’s underwhelming, but I loved standing near something so old and mysterious. Back in London we saw <em>Wicked</em> and <em>Matilda</em> in the West End. I played “Rudolpho” in <em>Matilda</em> the year before, so seeing a professional production was extra cool. “Defying Gravity” live gave me goosebumps.
</p>

<p>
By the end we’d hit the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, the Tate Modern, and more. London felt huge but friendly—history around every corner, with great food in between. The week flew by and definitely made me want to come back.
