I traveled to Amsterdam in August 2025, right before seventh grade began. It was a ten-day trip, and we stayed in Haarlem near the old square, surrounded by canals, windmills, and a huge cathedral that seemed to anchor the whole town. Haarlem felt quieter than Amsterdam itself but gave us an authentic sense of Dutch daily life, and it was easy to reach the city and the countryside from there.

The most powerful part of the trip was visiting Anne Frank’s House. I’ve been reading her story since second grade—first in the graphic novel version and later in the full diary—and it has shaped my interest in World War II. Standing in the rooms where she and her family hid made the history feel immediate and real. It was hard to imagine living in such a small space for years, but also inspiring to learn about Otto Frank’s dedication to preserving his daughter’s memory and voice.

We also spent time with one of my father’s school friends, who lives in Amsterdam with his three daughters. They showed us parts of Dutch life I might not have experienced otherwise. One day we rode bikes from Haarlem all the way to the North Sea coast, passing through dunes and seeing the wide, windy beaches. Another day we went to a climbing park with zip lines strung through the tree canopy, which was exciting and different from anything I’d done before. We also made a day trip to Volendam and the island of Marken, where the fishing villages still show traditional architecture and lifestyle.

Spending time in the Netherlands made me notice both similarities and differences with life back home. Bicycles seemed to be everywhere, and the way entire families rode together made me think about how car-dependent we are in California. The trains and buses were so frequent and reliable that it felt natural to move around without a car at all. Daily routines seemed shaped by this kind of accessibility and connection.

The food was another highlight. I loved bitterballen, which are little fried snacks filled with a savory meat filling, and I also had the chance to try Indonesian food. It was fascinating to taste how Dutch colonial history left its mark on the cuisine, with flavors that felt like a blend of Thai, Chinese, and Indian cooking. Together with the experiences of family, history, and the landscape, the trip gave me a rich picture of the Netherlands that went beyond just sightseeing.
